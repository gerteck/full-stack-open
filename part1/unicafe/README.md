# unicafe

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. The task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The application displays the total number of collected feedback for each category.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
