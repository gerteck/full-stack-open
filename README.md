This repo is for submissions for a course held at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, in collaboration with Open University.

This course covers React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript! It also goes through modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. Other courses relate various tools and technologies.
