# Simple Phonebook

Phonebook React App allows filtering of contacts, and adding new persons, updating of numbers, deletion of contacts.

Note that this application uses `json-server` to simulate a server.

**IMPORTANT**: 
* to run development environment, run both in separate cli windows:
```bash
npm run dev

```

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
